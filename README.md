# cpp-data-structures

Welcome to cpp-data-structures, a C++ repository featuring array-based projects that blend educational value with practical, product-focused applications. This collection includes three projects: the Personal Budget Tracker, the Enhanced Personal Budget Tracker, and the Dynamic Inventory Management System. Each demonstrates a range of array concepts—from basic to advanced—while offering real-world utility for personal finance and business inventory management.

## Projects Overview

### Arrays

#### 1. Personal Budget Tracker

- File: `budget_tracker_basic.cpp`
- Excerpt: A simple console tool for tracking expenses across categories, with features to add expenses, view summaries, and sort by amount. It uses dynamic arrays to manage data and saves progress to a file.
- Learning Points: Basic array operations, dynamic memory with raw pointers, sorting (bubble sort), file I/O, and console-based UI design.
- Target Audience: Beginners learning array fundamentals or individuals needing a lightweight budget tool.

#### 2. Enhanced Personal Budget Tracker

- File: `budget_tracker_enhanced.cpp`
- Excerpt: An upgraded budgeting tool supporting multiple users, budget limits with alerts, and persistent data storage. It offers a menu-driven interface for managing expenses across different users.
- Learning Points: Structs with arrays (via vector), simplified dynamic memory, multi-user data management, advanced file I/O, and practical feature design (e.g., budget alerts).
- Target Audience: Intermediate learners or small households/businesses seeking a robust financial tracker.

#### 3. Dynamic Inventory Management System

- File: `inventory_manager.cpp`
- Excerpt: A sophisticated system for managing inventory across multiple warehouses, featuring product tracking, analytics (total value, low stock), and fast search/sort capabilities. It uses raw arrays for advanced memory control.
- Learning Points: Multi-dimensional arrays, manual dynamic resizing, array of pointers, quicksort, binary search, and complex data persistence.
- Target Audience: Advanced developers or small businesses/warehouses needing scalable inventory solutions.

#### Learning Objectives

- Beginners: Start with budget_tracker_basic.cpp for foundational array skills.
- Intermediate: Explore budget_tracker_enhanced.cpp for structs, dynamic arrays, and user-focused design.
- Advanced: Tackle inventory_manager.cpp for cutting-edge array techniques and algorithmic efficiency.
- Product Developers: Learn to build scalable, customer-ready tools with real-world applications.
